# Vision and BHAG (Sanitized)

## Mission
Build a reproducible, safety-first security operations blueprint that can be
operated by well-defined agents, validated continuously, and evolved without
guesswork.

## Big Hair Audacious Goals (BHAG)
- End-to-end signal flow (detect -> triage -> enrich -> respond) is automated
  and observable with a single validation command.
- All critical changes are codified, reversible, and auditable.
- The environment can be rehydrated from scratch with minimal manual steps.
- Public documentation stays sanitized while still explaining architecture and
  trade-offs clearly.

## Success Signals
- Green validation playlist on demand.
- Alerts land in case management with enrichment attached.
- Rollback steps exist for every automated change.
- Documentation stays in sync with automation.

## Non-Goals
- Production hardening for a real enterprise environment.
- Publishing any secrets, tokens, or private infrastructure details.

## Guiding Principles
- Safety and reproducibility first.
- Minimal diffs, maximum clarity.
- Validation hooks for every change.
- Least privilege by default.
